# edr-soc-lab

## Project: 
For this lab project, we are simulating a real cyber attack and utlizing endpoint detection and reponse. The attack is delpoyed by an Ubuntu virtual machine (attacker) which will target a Windows endpoint virtual machine (victim). On the Ubuntu VM, we are using Sliver-Server, a command and control (C2) framework designed for adversary and red team testing. On the Windows VM, we are running LimaCharlie, an EDR tool, to capture and take action against malicious activity.

#

**Tools and Technologies Used:**

- VMware Workstation Pro (Hypervisor)
    - Ubuntu VM (Adversary)
    - Windows 10 VM (Victim)
- LimaCharlie (SecOps Cloud EDR)
- Sliver-Server (C2 Attack Payload Tool)
